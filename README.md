This tool is provided to ease the procedure of calculating the amount of required fertilizer point applications with a bottle lid, technique commonly practiced in Africa. One bottle lid full of one fertilizer will have a different weight compared to the same bottle lid full of another type of fertilizer, as fertilizers are known to vary in density. With this web app in just a few clicks one can figure out correct amount to apply taking into consideration planting spacing, fertilizer type and application rate.
